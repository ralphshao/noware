Noware
======

Sure, Google's updates to Gmail to have it host open tracking images is a nice step, but what about click tracking URLs?

Noware is a Chrome extension that replaces Yesware click tracking URLs with direct URLs instead.

I may periodically update this to include other major click tracking services if I find they annoy me.
